<h1> Welcome to Abhi's Django for everyone project! </h1>

<strong>I am an engineering manager by profession and manage an engineering team building an enterprise product. </strong>

<em> I have always wanted to build websites and host web applications on my own! </em>

<div>
While I have tried building RoR projects in the past, wasn't sure about the popularity of the language and support.
That is when I learnt about Python & Django.

I came across <a href="https://www.dj4e.com/">DJ4E </a> which is a wonderful site to learn Django by example.
<a href="https://www.dr-chuck.com/"> Dr. Charles R Severance </a>  has done a wonderful job in teaching the course.
Unlike other online django resources, he not only explains how to get things working but also what happens behind the scenes to make things work.

<p style="color: red;"> This is the example of a new paragraph </p>

<ul>
    <li> I like programming </li>
    <li> I would like to build a portfolio management system <span>(PMS) </span> for myself </li>
    <li> I would like to build and export REST interfaces for my PMS </li>
    <li> I would like to integrate the PMS with <a href="https://kite.trade/">Zerodha's </a>APIs to build an automatic PMS </li>
    <li> I would like to build an expense tracker for myself which can help in financial planning </li>

</ul>
